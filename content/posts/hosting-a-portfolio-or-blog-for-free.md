Portfolio websites are pretty common among students and indie developers. They are super useful for displaying personal achievements, cool tech or being noticed recruiters.

Last year I found a neat collection of services aimed at creating your very own website much more easily, and I decided to write up an article about it. I hope you'll find this useful.

## Step 1 - Acquiring a Domain Name

There are a couple of things you need to worry about when picking a domain.

1. The domain registrar
2. The domain extension
3. The domain name
4. Domain privacy / ID Protect

### The Domain Registrar

The registrar is simply the provider through which you will purchase your desired domain name. Each registar has it's own services such as website builders, professional business email, web hosting, etc. but we're not concerned with that since we'll have our own hosting solution.

I've personally used [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), [Siteground](http://www.siteground.com), and [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com). I've also heard good things about [Google domains](https://domains.google/).

What you'll be mostly concerned with is reputation, customer service, and price which we'll look into next. Just do your research depending on your needs and budget.

### The Domain Extension

The price of your domain will not depend on the actual name but on the domain extension. The extension is the last part of the [url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). The more technical name for them are "top-level domains" which you can find a list of [here](http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt).

Let's take a look at GoDaddy to get an idea of prices and extensions available.

All you have to do is head over [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com) and type in the name of your desired domain. You'll be taken to a result page that will tell you if the domain of your choice is available and the extensions available for it.

Availability is based on extensions, not name!
This means if someone has already reserved yourwebsite.com, you would still be able to reserve yourwebsite.net if it's available.

#### Which extension should I choose?

This is debatable. The famous **.com** is definitely the most popular for historical reasons (it was one of the first top-level domains to come out) and because it has sort of a professional connotation. Now, I'm no expert but according to [Joseph Peterson](https://www.startups.com/community/experts/10652/josephpeterson),
".COM isn't always the only answer. But for global or U.S.-based projects, a business must seriously evaluate any decision to neglect .COM."

Some of the issues he mentions are brand protection, search-engine competition, perceived amateurishness versus professionalism, familiarity, memorability, and permanence ([for a more detailed explanation](https://www.startups.com/community/questions/2184/how-important-is-it-to-have-a-com-domain-when-starting-up-a-business)).

While this is certainly sound advice, I don't deal in absolutes, and so I believe there are certainly exceptions. This blog uses the **.blog** extension simply because it was cheaper at the time of purchase and because it worked with my branding. In other words, it made sense to brand a website as a blog and use the approriate extension.

There are many more extensions that can be used in clever ways (the [Freedom Press Foundation](https://freedom.press) uses the .press extension) such as the **.store** extension if you own a store (why not?).

### The Domain Name

Most of the time, people will already have a company name in mind and simply use that. If it's taken, there are ways to be creative while still retaining your original brand. For example, let's say I wanted to reserve the *goodgames* domain but it was already taken I could change the spelling or simple add "*studio*" to it and see if that's available.

Otherwise, you can also take a look at the different variations of *top-level domains* for which your desired name is available.

### Domain privacy / ID Protect

When you reserve a domain without domain privacy (sometimes called ID Protect), your ownership information is put in a global domain owner's database. That means anyone who looks up your website on a WHOIS engine such as [this one](https://lookup.icann.org/) can see your name, address, phone number, email which puts you at risk for spam, scam or even identity theft.

I think it's safe to say ID Protect is definitely worth the price.

## The Framework

Now the thing that'll save you the most time is a **site generator** framework. There are many available and I've personally tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

My personal favorite the subjet of today's article is GatsbyJS but I encourage you to take a look at alternatives if you'd like to try them out as well.
