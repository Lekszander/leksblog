description: The blog is up! More about me and what I intend to do with this website.

---
Ever since I started programming I noticed a very good way for me to assimilate new knowledge was to synthesize it and write it down or teach someone else about my findings.

[Studies back this up](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/ "Teaching as a learning method"), and I believe this learning method also has the added benefit of helping you cultivate your pedagogical and leadership skills which are very sought-after in the industry.

Evidently, this blog will serve as a sort of development diary for me as I continue learning and find out things that I consider worthy of sharing with the world.

I mainly dabble with Unreal Engine and Unity3D, although I like to think a good programmer is tool agnostic!

If you're interested, I encourage you to take a look at my [portfolio](/pages/portfolio/ "Portfolio") and the [about](/pages/about/ "About") section to find out more about my background.
