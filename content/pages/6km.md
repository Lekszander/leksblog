**Six Kilometers, or 6 Km,** is an online third-person co-op puzzle-adventure game developped during the course of Ubisoft Game Lab 2018. The latter is a university-level competition, organized by Ubisoft Montreal every winter since 2009, during which students from all over Quebec are paired with two Ubisoft employees as mentors (a programmer and an artist/designer) and tasked with developing a game over the course of 10 weeks following a certain theme, some guidelines and constraints given by a jury of Ubisoft professionnals.

## Development Team

6Km was the joint effort of four programmers from [ETS Montreal](https://etsmtl.ca) and four artists from [Centre NAD](https://nad.ca).

Johncarlo worked on the level design, and collaborated with Matthew, who worked on game flow, obstacles and puzzles, to come up with a design that leveraged our main mechanic: co-op movement. Jérôme and I worked on network programming, UI and 3C, while Kerby and Maxime took care of audio integration and AI respectively. Finally, Georgette worked on our models and Sandrine did all of our textures and lighting.

## Opportunity of a Lifetime
If you've read [my about page](/pages/about), you know I had never worked for any video game studio before, so my experience amounted to a couple of game jams and small prototypes I'd made on my own time between university classes.

This [competition](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/education/university/) was the opportunity of a lifetime for me. Firstly, Ubisoft offers mentorship both on the design & art side and the programming side for every team that participates. These mentors are Ubisoft employees willing to give back to the community. Our mentors were [Paul Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-green-3b916911/) and [Alex Gilbert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-gilbert-4847123a/). Paul has been a level designer since 2006. He's worked on Grand Theft Auto IV, Bioshock Infinite, and more recently, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Origins, and Far Cry 5. As for Alex, he's been working as a gameplay programmer (and an extremely talented one at that) for Ubisoft since 2014.

## New Beginnings
This project had a lot of firsts for me. It was my first experience working on a project larger than a game jam, my first time collaborating with artists, my first experience with the C++ language and my first time with the Unreal Engine. All in all, I experienced what was at the time, the closest thing I had lived resembling professional game developement work.

On this project, I worked mostly on 3C and UI. My friend Jerome and I worked side-by-side on our main mechanic: server authoritative co-op movement. This was an interesting challenge for us since none of us had ever done any net code.

The theme for this competition was "Change the world". We had to come up with a game concept that was tied to any cause we liked. Georgette whom I've mentionned previously is originally from Peru whose rural population has been battling with poor access to safe water. She came up with the idea of two siblings having to gather water and carry it back to their village. The spark of creativity was ignited. We all loved the suggestion and we couldn't wait to work on our prototype.

## The Payoff

On the day of the awards ceremony, eight winning teams were selected by a jury of Ubisoft employees. Let me stress that you **really** want to impress these people since they're often high in the company hierarchy: project managers, directors, etc. One of the judges for the 2019 edition was [Yannis Mallat himself](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/yannis-mallat-president-of-the-jury-for-the-ubisoft-game-lab-competitions-9th-edition/) the CEO of Ubisoft's Canadian Studios!

We had high hopes that night and it all paid off when we heard our game nominated twice! Before the ceremony, we all agreed that winning wasn't the point, after all, experience was more important for us at this point in our careers. Imagine our surprise when our game was announced as the winning prototype for the Jury's Special Award!

Everyone was all smiles and we couldn't believe what we had achieved especially since some of us were just starting out. The outcome of all this? A couple months later I got an interview for a paid gameplay programming internship of 8 months on an unannounced project at Ubisoft Montreal... and I got it. This was all I'd worked for the past year.

## What Came Next

As a result of our efforts, two members of our team were offered permanent jobs at Ubisoft Montreal once they graduated (Johncarlo and Sandrine) and two more were offered 8 months paid internship since we weren't graduating yet (Jerome and I).

If you're a university student living in Quebec and have considered a career in video games, I urge you to participate in this competition. I strongly believe it can be career defining and definitely opens a lot of doors.
