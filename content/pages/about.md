## Hi, I'm Alex!

Online, I go by Lekszander, and I'm a student at [ETS Montreal](https://etsmtl.ca) currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I'm part of a video game development club called [Conjure](https://conjure.etsmtl.ca) and I cumulate 16 months of internship experience at Ubisoft working on internal tools and, more recently, as a gameplay programmer on an unannounced title.

## Ubisoft Game Lab Competition

In 2018, I participated in the [Ubisoft Game Lab Competition](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/education/university/game-lab-competition/) in which teams from universities all over Qu√©bec engage in a 10-week game prototype development cycle. That year my team and I won the Jury's Special Award. This was especially significant for me since it was my first experience with C++ and Unreal Engine.

## The Next Chapter

Since then I've been refining my skills, expanding my network and looking for opportunities to improve.

I worked on the [Yumi prototype](/pages/yumi) with some friends and I was invited to present an award for the 2019 edition of the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition.

Recently, I've mostly been working on a few prototypes and learning 3D modelling, rigging and animation while I finish my degree.

My most recent project is this blog, which represents a way for me to give back to the community and provides me with an opportunity for personal growth as I perfect my writing skills (as you might have noticed, english isn't my first language).

I hope you'll enjoy reading my work and hopefully interact with me through the comment section!

## Conjure Club

This page wouldn't be complete without a shoutout to the [Conjure](https://conjure.etsmtl.ca) club itself. Thanks to its administrators efforts and our university's very proactive stance towards student groups, Conjure has flourished tremendously in the past 10 years. Through the years, we've been sponsored by **Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers, Behaviour Interactive, Square Enix, Eidos, Beenox, Unity3D, Ludia, Redbull and Google**. We've organized the Montreal chapter of the Global Game Jam
