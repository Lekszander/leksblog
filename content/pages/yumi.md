**Yumi** was developed by a team of artists from [Centre NAD](https://nad.ca) and myself as sole programmer. You can find an exhaustive list of our team members at the end of the video linked above. This served as the artists' graduation project.

## Development Team
Most of the team was composed of members of the [6 Km](/pages/6km) team whom I had previously worked with. Lucas Homont took care of the soundtrack.

## Balancing School and Game Developing

I took on this project almost right after 6 Km. The idea was to work on it part-time and keep studying full-time. Our vision for Yumi was that we wanted it to be more of a contemplative, slow-paced game with very simple mechanics. This would lighten the workload for me since I was pretty busy with school and would allow the artists and designers to truly focus on their craft and make the game as beautiful as their heart desired.

For me this was a way of keeping my skills sharp and keeping myself motivated throughout my semester before my gameplay programming internship at Ubisoft Montreal a couple months ahead.

## Lessons Learned

When I started working on Yumi, I was still riding the high of the success we'd had with 6 Km.
I expressed my will to work on this project as solo programmer since I had gained some confidence in my skills and I was now much more familiar with Unreal Engine and C++. I managed to complete all my 3C, UI and AI tasks and even fiddled around a bit with custom engine modules.

## Reception
Visually the game was stunning and our gameplay was simple enough that everyone could grab a controller and enjoy a complete walkthrough in about 10 minutes which was our original target. The game was presented at [ImagiNAD 2018](https://www.nad.ca/fr/evenement/imaginad/details) in front of hundreds of family members, friends, fellow students and industry professionals.

Overall, Yumi had a very positive reception and those who had seen our previous game noticed how much the visuals had improved.

Here are a couple of photos taken during the event:
